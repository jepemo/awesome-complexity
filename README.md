## Concepts

### Definitions

> About complexity science, which is an interdisciplinary field—at the intersection of mathematics, computer science and natural science—that focuses on discrete models of physical systems. In particular, it focuses on complex systems, which are systems with many interacting components. - [Think Complexity Book](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/html/index.html)

> Complexity characterises the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity)

> Complexity theory is really a movement of the sciences. Standard sciences tend to see the world as mechanistic...The movement that started complexity looks in the other direction. It’s asking, how do things assemble themselves? How do patterns emerge from these interacting elements? Complexity is looking at interacting elements and asking how they form patterns and how the patterns unfold. - [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Systems_theory)
